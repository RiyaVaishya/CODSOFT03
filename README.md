## TASK-03

# Iris Flower Species Classification

This project aims to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for this classification task is the famous Iris dataset, which consists of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Dataset:-

The dataset used in this project is available in the `IRIS.csv` file. It contains the following columns:

- `Id`: Unique identifier for each data entry
- `SepalLengthCm`: Length of the sepal in centimeters
- `SepalWidthCm`: Width of the sepal in centimeters
- `PetalLengthCm`: Length of the petal in centimeters
- `PetalWidthCm`: Width of the petal in centimeters
- `Species`: The species of the Iris flower (setosa, versicolor, or virginica)

## Steps:-

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Checking for missing values
   - Visualizing the data distribution using histograms, pairplots, boxplots, and correlation matrices

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Separating features and target variable
   - Encoding the categorical target variable into numeric values
   - Standardizing the features using `StandardScaler`

3. **Model Training**:
   - Using a Random Forest Classifier to train the model on the dataset

4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix

5. **Making Predictions**:
   - Predicting the species of new Iris flowers using the trained model

## Dependencies:-

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Conclusion:-

This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. By following the steps outlined in this README file and running the provided code, you can understand the data, train a model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions on new data. The Random Forest Classifier achieved a high accuracy in classifying Iris flowers, showcasing the effectiveness of machine learning in this classification task.
